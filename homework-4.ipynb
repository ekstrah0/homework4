What is the minimum fragment length where we can unambiguously reconstruct the initial spike protein nucleotide sequence? In other words, what is smallest k for k-mers where we obtain exactly one valid assembly from our `assemble_genome` function? Save your answer into the `minimum_fragment_length` variable.

    "\n",
    "In the real world, these assumptions would hold no water. Many things have to be taken into consideration. For example, biologists first prepare the tissue to be sequenced. Imagine someone is preparing to sequence some mouse tissue, but they forget to wear gloves and contaminate the sample with some of their own cells, and bacteria from their hands. Then the mouse sample may contain human and bacterial DNA instead of just mouse DNA. Next, the sequencing process splits the DNA molecules into short fragments at random, so we might have the same region sequenced twice, while some regions will be completely skipped. Finally, the sequencing process itself works something like this: for every nucleotide in a sequence there exists some colored reagent which binds to it. So every base, ACTG, is assigned its own color. Each nucleotide then goes under a large microscopic camera, which literally takes pictures of every nucleotide, one by one. Then, this sequence of colors is converted into a nucleotide sequence. However, sometimes reagents don't bind to the nucleotides perfectly, so this can cause ambiguities or errors in the reads.\n",

Think back to homework 2, where we looked at sequence alignment tools. Could we use some of that machinery to help with assembling the SARS-CoV-2 genome?
